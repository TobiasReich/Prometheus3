1
00:00:26,328 --> 00:00:29,480
Hello, these are the recordings
of John Greenwitch

2
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:34,613
I'm working for the Project Pandora as a
Biologist for the Prometheus Corporation

3
00:00:34,727 --> 00:00:40,238
Ehm... and I... still can't
believe to be here

4
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:44,221
Huh! I mean, it' s not about
the salary, it's about...

5
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:47,947
working on a real
Priority Two project

6
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:51,011
The equipment is unbelievable,
the possibilities, the the...

7
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:55,779
THIS is science at the highest level

8
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:59,434
God, am I happy to be here
Huh!

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,804
Day 21

10
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:04,400
This virus is still a
puzzle to all of us

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,570
It's mutating so fast and
it is so contagious,

12
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,453
how can we ever manage
to develop an antidote?

13
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:13,788
Not speaking of synthesizing
it for everybody

14
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:16,902
Of course, the executive board was
not particularly happy about it, but

15
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:20,315
despite falling revenues, we have
been upgraded to Priority One 

16
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:22,564
Which means, we get more
money for this project

17
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:25,409
I hope, this will help us a bit

18
00:01:25,548 --> 00:01:27,347
Day 47

19
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:29,595
We got a step closer
to the antidote

20
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:31,734
but it is still a long way to go

21
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:33,687
It seems that the virus is mutating,

22
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:35,899
changing its DNA structure again and again

23
00:01:36,602 --> 00:01:37,620
And the antidote?

24
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,189
The antidote has to match this
DNA structure precisely

25
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,705
That means, we will never manage

26
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:47,937
to produce an antidote
long time in advance

27
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:50,822
We have a long way to go

28
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,934
Day 84

29
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:55,128
We have taken a great step forward

30
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:57,476
Anderson perfected the antidote

31
00:01:57,476 --> 00:02:00,049
I believe, with the right DNA coding,

32
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,572
we can stop the virus

33
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:06,160
The management was impressed
but not impressed enough

34
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:07,692
They have transferred him

35
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:09,450
No money for research, they say

36
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,284
And since when does a Priority One
project become short of money?

37
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:16,980
Day 98

38
00:02:17,348 --> 00:02:19,542
The working climate is strained

39
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:23,494
McRich just quit
without another word 

40
00:02:23,494 --> 00:02:27,317
And Anderson?
Disappeared without a trace

41
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:28,758
No one knows anything

42
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:31,491
Well, I could imagine
they have fired him

43
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:35,788
after the trouble he made
but why does nobody know anything?

44
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:39,239
Seems as though I am the only
one left working on Pandora

45
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:42,081
Day 103

46
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:43,876
Today I received an anonymous letter

47
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:45,846
containing only a
micro SD card

48
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:46,902
The data encrypted

49
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:50,053
I think, they are...
from the... laboratory

50
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:52,971
Someone passed Pandora's
documents to me


51
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:57,445
McRich perhaps? What if they
want to silence him?

52
00:02:57,445 --> 00:03:01,430
Maybe I'm getting paranoid but

53
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,223
isn't it a strange coincidence
that Anderson had this...

54
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:08,863
accident at this precise moment?


55
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:10,645
I need to watch out whom I trust

56
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:14,452
Day 116

57
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:16,787
Section seven has been closed

58
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:17,990
Lacking money, they say

59
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,517
Project Pandora?
Project Pandora discontinued

60
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:22,432
for ever

61
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:24,526
all recordings deleted

62
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:29,755
but why deleting all documents
when discontinuing a project?

63
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:32,092
I've been transferred

64
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:34,226
Priority Four

65
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:37,505
Well and today's question is:

66
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:43,099
What goes wrong when a virologist
suddenly has to research on hay fever? 

67
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,726
Let's find it out

68
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:48,860
Day 120

69
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,305
My inquiries to the management
attract attention

70
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:56,111
Just now in the corridor
Wilhemsen himself asked me

71
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,886
to stop nosing around

72
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:02,609
He said he could not guarantee
my safety any more

73
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,824
Whatever that may mean?

74
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,573
Let's find it out

75
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:10,840
Day 123

76
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,850
My last

77
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,239
Asking questions became
quite unpleasant

78
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:24,238
I'm being... watched...
My telephone's tapped

79
00:04:24,238 --> 00:04:29,633
My apartment...
Someone broke into my apartment

80
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:36,622
I've put the SD card to
a save place and ehm...

81
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:41,699
Maybe I'm becoming paranoid but
I've got the feeling, that this is...

82
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,468
the only reason why I...

83
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:50,230
why nothing has happened to me yet

84
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:52,667
Well who knows...

85
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,766
That is all
